This is the third and final stage of the three-stage course material project <b>Restaurant Reviews</b>. Building upon the responsive, accessible and connected application that was developed incrementally in the first two stages, the app should now provide additional functionality. Users should now be able to create their own reviews and add restaurants in their favorites list. If the app is offline, form submissions should defer updating to the remote database until a connection is established. The preparation to start working on this project and implement the requirements documented below, included:

 - Fork and clone the [**stage-3 Node development server**](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3) repository.
 - Run the development server locally to develop the project code.<br><br>
 
## Project Requirements
 
  - **User Interface:** Users are able to mark a restaurant as a favorite (and remove a restaurant from favorites), this toggle is visible in the application. Users are also able to add their own reviews for a restaurant. Form submission works properly and adds a new review to the database.

  - **Offline Use:** The client application works offline. JSON responses are cached using the IndexedDB API. Any data previously accessed while connected is reachable while offline. Users are able to mark a restaurant as a favorite (and remove a restaurant from favorites) while offline and the request is sent to the server when connectivity is re-established. Users are able to add a review to a restaurant while offline and the review is sent to the server when connectivity is re-established.
  
 - **Responsive Design:** The application maintains a responsive design on mobile, tablet and desktop viewports. All new features are responsive, including the form to add a review and the control for marking a restaurant as a favorite.

 - **Accessibility:** The application retains accessibility features from the previous projects. Images have alternate text, the application uses appropriate focus management for navigation, semantic elements and ARIA attributes are used correctly. Roles are correctly defined for all elements of the review form. Modal or interstitial windows appropriately lock focus.

 - **Meet Performance Requirements:** Optimize the site to ensure that the following performance benchmarks are satisfied (measure performance using the Lighthouse):
   - **Progressive Web App** score should be at **90 or better**.
   - **Performance** score should be at **90 or better**.
   - **Accessibility** score should be at **90 or better**.
 
## Local Setup of the Project

1. Fork and clone the [**stage-3 Node development server**](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3) repository.
